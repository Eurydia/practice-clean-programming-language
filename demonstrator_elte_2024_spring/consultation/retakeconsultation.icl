Your submission should not have any errors when running the code.

It is possible to get partial points for not fully working code, but please make sure you comment out the errors.

You should not delete anything from the given code, given test cases should stay the same, but you can add your tests as well.

Given a positive integer number, check if the given number
is a Disarium number or not.

//// Harshad numbers
/*2.
Given a list of positive integer numbers, return a list that

'a' + 2 = 'c' ... Here we ciphered 'a' into 'c'
'c' + 2 = 'e' ... We did the same as above
